	<h1>Stir-fried Pea Sprouts with Garlic </h1>
		<h2>A Recipe of Kasma Loha-unchit</h2> 

 

<ul>Ingredients </ul>

8 cups or about 1 lb. pea sprouts 
8 cloves garlic 
3 Tbs. peanut oil 
1/2 – 1 tsp. sea salt, to taste 
1/2 – 1 tsp. sugar, to taste 
1 – 2 Tbs. water – only as needed 

Heat a wok until the surface is smoking hot. Swirl in the oil to coat the wok surface and allow to heat up until it is smoking. Stir in the garlic, followed a few seconds later with the sprouts. Stir-fry vigorously to wilt the pea sprouts evenly and keep them from burning. When a large portion of the sprouts has begun to wilt, sprinkle in the sea salt. Continue to stir-fry. If your wok appears too hot and may burn the sprouts, sprinkle in a little water to help cook. Add a little sugar and stir-fry the sprouts until all of them are wilted and cooked. Pea sprouts wilt down quite a bit – to about 1/4 to 1/3 of its original mass.

Roast Duck Thai Curry (Gkaeng Ped Bped) 

Ingredients 
An approximately 1 1/2-lb. kabocha or other winter squash 
4-5 cups coconut milk (use two 19-oz cans of the Mae Ploy brand) 
4-6 Tbs. red curry paste 
1 1/2 to 2 Tbs. palm or coconut sugar 
Fish sauce as needed to desired saltiness 
2 1/2 to 3 lb. roast duck, chopped through the bone into small chunks 
2-4 red hot chillies, cut into thin slivers with seeds (optional) 
2 cups Thai basil leaves and flower buds 
Basil sprig(s) for garnish 
Cut the kabocha in half, scoop out the seeds and pith. Placing the cut ends flat on a surface for balance, peel and discard the greenish skin. Then cut into 1 to 1 1/2-inch chunks. 

Do not shake the cans of coconut milk before opening. Spoon 2/3 cup of the thickest cream off the top of a can into a large pot placed over medium-high heat. Reduce cream until thick and bubbly (about 3 minutes), then add the curry paste. Stir and mush the paste into the coconut cream and fry for a few minutes until it is very aromatic and darkened in color. Then pour in the remaining milk from both cans, stirring well to dissolve the paste to make a smooth rich sauce. 

Add 1 1/2 Tbs. of palm or coconut sugar, stirring well to blend into the curry sauce. Taste and add fish sauce only as necessary to salt to the desired saltiness (may not be necessary with some brands of curry paste which are already highly salted). 

Add the kabocha chunks and duck pieces. Stir well into the sauce. If there is not enough curry sauce to cover most of the duck and squash pieces, add more coconut milk; or if the sauce already looks plenty rich, add 1/2 cup of water instead, as the squash and duck will thicken and enrich the sauce even more when they are cooked. 

Return to a boil, then lower heat to medium, or just enough to boil the sauce gently. Cook partially covered, stirring occasionally, until the squash is tender, or cooked to your liking (15-20 minutes or more). Taste the sauce and adjust as needed with fish sauce and palm sugar to the desired salty-sweet combination. If more hotness is desired, stir in the slivered chillies. 

If a lot of fat has cooked out from the duck, skim out the oil floating on top of the curry sauce. Then stir in the basil until it wilts to a bright green color. Turn off heat and spoon curry into a serving dish. Garnish top with basil sprig(s).
