Achill is an island off the west coast of Ireland. It is the largest offshore island in Ireland but is connected to the mainland by a bridge. Achill is world famous for its beautiful scenery. If you are into the outdoors, this is the place for you! Keel Beach is a great place to go surfing, with huge waves rolling in from the Atlantic. Slievemore and Croaghan are two of the highest mountains in Mayo and are a challenging day's hillwalking. The cliffs of Achill Head are the highest cliffs in Europe. Achill has some great pubs, with traditional sessions every weekend.

<strong>Where I study<strong>
<br />
I am in the second year of a four-year Business Studies degree in <em>the University College of Galway.</em> We study lots of different subjects, such as Accounting, Law, and Psychology. The area I am most interested in is Information Technology and I hope to specialise in E-Commerce. I share a house with three other lads from Galway, who are great craic. It's hard to get any study done because they are always dragging me out to the pub.

<strong>My Hobbies</strong>
<br />
I like listening to music and going to concerts. My favourite bands are Coldplay and Badly Drawn Boy. There's a great live music scene in Galway and you can catch a live band practically every night of the week. Unfortunately, I can't afford to do that! I love to go surfing when I'm back in Achill and during the summer, I work as a lifeguard on Keel Beach. The rest of my time is taken up with studying. Study! Study! Study! I'm sure it will be worth it some day!
